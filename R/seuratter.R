#' Calculates The Optimum Dimensionality From An Elbow Plot.
#'
#' A function that calculates the optimum dimensionality from an elbow plot. Involves calculating
#' slopes between two consecutive points. The optimum dimensionality will be determined as the point at
#' which slopes no longer change or no visible change occurs to the slopes thereafter. In this function, a dimension
#' is determined optimal when a slope connecting that point to another is flatter than 10 times the flattest slope
#' in the plot and the stdev at that point is proximal to the lower limit.
#' The plot data must be plotted by dims (x-axis) and stdev (y-axis).
#'
#' @param plot_data An elbow plot data used for detemining dimensionality, generated by calling ElbowPlot() on a Seurat object.
#' @param cutoff The cutoff that indicates how much data/variance is covered.
#'
#' @return Returns an integer that represents the optimal dimensionality that was determined by calculation.
