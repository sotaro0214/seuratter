#' Calculates The Optimum Dimensionality From An Elbow Plot.
#'
#' A function that calculates the optimum dimensionality from an elbow plot. Involves calculating
#' slopes of the lines that begin from each point to the last point. The optimum dimensionality will
#' be determined as the point at which slopes no longer change or no visible change occurs to the slopes
#' thereafter. The plot data must be plotted by dims (x-axis) and stdev (y-axis).
#'
#' @param plot An elbow plot data used for detemining dimensionality, generated by calling ElbowPlot() on a Seurat object.
#'
#' @return Returns an integer that represents the dimensionality that was determined by calculation.

#' Extracts Genes Expressed By A Cluster.
#'
#' A function that utilizes a Seurat function to identify and extract gene expression profiles of a cluster.
#' Involves identifying all genes expressed by more than a certain percentage of cells (recommend 0.25) in the cluster and does not take into account
#' the uniquesness of expression among other clusters. In other words, does not focus on cluster specific genes but also
#' involves genes that are generally expressed.
#'
#'
#' @param seurat_object A Seurat object that has undergone the entire workflow, involving UMAP.
#' @param cluster_num An integer representing the cluster.
#' @param min_percent A float representing the percentage of cells that have to express the gene to be included in the result.
#'
#' @return Returns a vector of gene names that are expressed by the cluster identified by cluster_num

#' Compares Genes Expressed In Each Cluster.
#'
#' A function that compares and compiles all the genes identified by extract_genes_expressed into one matrix
#'
#' @param seurat_object A Seurat object that has undergone the entire workflow, involving UMAP.
#'
#' @return Returns a matrix of cluster id by cluster id, with each matrix cell (x,y) containing the vector genes expressed by both clusters x and y.
